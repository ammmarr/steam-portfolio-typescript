              Hey! I&apos;m Ammar, if you haven&apos;t already gathered that by
              now. I&apos;m a coach turned software engineer from Egypt.
              I specialize in the Front end, primarily NextJs and React, but
              love building with whatever tools are right for the job.

              I currently work as a freelancer on Upwork. I also toss in my Â¢2
              with the backend systems teams from time to time (as i strongly familiar with backend technologies).

            <p className={styles.aboutText}>

              Outside of work, I still love to exercise, spend some quality time with my family, and of course, mess around with whatever I am learning.

              I&apos;m actively looking for new positions where I can join a team to utilize my
              love for code and building stuff. If you think
