          Wilma is a real-time Resturant Application for resturant owners.
          This app is my baby, designed and built on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tech stack is based on top of NextJS for the mobile app,
          connected to a Nextjs api Routes, with data stored in MongoDB,
          demo deployed on Vercel.
        </p>

        <p>
          What i really struggled with at first was connecting the database, Turns out Nextjs Had alot of problems saving and Running Mongoose, Needles to say everything is solved now :)
        </p>
        <p>
          here are more info why I chosen what I have chosen ={">"}
        </p>
        <p>{' '}</p>
        <p>
          - I have chosen to build this application using the latest NextJS for its unique features
          as  SSR, SEO optimization, and Images handling and responisvness
        </p>
        <p>
          - used framer motion to add some cool interactive animations

        </p>

        <p>- used JWT for protecting routes and admin login  </p>
        <p>
          - used MonogDB AS the Main DataBase

        </p>
        <p>
          - used SASS Modules for styling and responsiveness

        </p>
        <p>
          - used Formik and Yup for form validation and handling

        </p>
        <p>- I surely practiced the SOLID princibles for writing clean and maintainable code</p>

          Movies surfer is an open source application for searching and adding movies to their watch later list
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a movie application built completely on React, TypeScript.
          I used Firebase( Authentication and FireStore ) for a quick and interactive app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding to that, I used Redux for state management and Redux thunk for API Calls management,

        </p>
        <p>
          Needless to say, the whole app is responsive, and used SASS for the styles

          I consider this one of the most challenging projects I have ever worked on,

          I really enjoyed building it despite all the challenges I had to face during the process of developing it,
          from animating and implementing the algorithms to designing and visualizing them,
        </p>
        <p>
          I have utilized the latest React18 technologies with Redux for managing the state

        <p>Alright, I know this seems so easy</p>
        <p>
          Point is,I put this project just to show i used to spend days even week on something the could last me five minutes now.
        </p>
        <p>You are probably wondering how is that a good thing, let me tell why</p>
        <p>
          When i started out I started asking people and engineers that i look up to in this field,
          They all agreed one Thing
        </p>
        <p>
          {""} Get Your hands dirty, and throw youself in the ocean if you dont know how to swim, and this is a skill game not knowledge game {""}
        </p>
        <p>
          to answer the question of why I puy intended to put this my projects list, is that those 10 projects are the projects who I struggled with the most, these are the projects taught me the most about the enviroment that I am gonna be living if I am gonna pursue this career, the certainity of every bug is gonna be fixed if you just stayed consistent.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope this was inspirational enough to hire me, just kidding :) ,
          here are the list of projects it includes.
